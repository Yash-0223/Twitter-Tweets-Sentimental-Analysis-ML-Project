# Twitter-Tweets-Sentimental-Analysis-ML-Project

#
##  <h>  **Analysis of Twitter's User's Sentiments regarding Twitter's Services with Machine Learning and Python (Pandas, NLTK, RE, Seaborn, Matplotlib, NumPy etc).**

**The Project is aimed to provide an analysis of the Sentiments of the Users of Twitter Social Media Platform using Machine Learning Models like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest based upon their Ratings and Reviews. The Project's objectives were to build a ML Model that can accurately predict the Sentiments (Positive/Negative) of the users on the basis of the Ratings and the content of the Reviews provided by it's users. The aim was to assist the Social media platforms with the information that they can use to formulate their strategy in order to enhance the User's satisfaction and expand their user base. Additionally, different ML Models have been compared on the basis of their Accuracy Score and other Key Metrics, to find out the best fit model for the task. Moreover, it aimed to reveal some of the dataset's hidden insights. The Data Cleaning was done with Pandas. The ML Models were built with NLTK, RE and Pandas, whereas the analysis of the data has been done with Pandas and visualisation library, Seaborn. This project was completed under the supervision of respected Mr. Tejas Natani, Instructional Associate at Masai School within 2 days.**

    o       Analysed the Accuracy Scores of Different ML Models for predicting the Sentiments.
    
    o	Also analysed the F1 Scores, Precision Scores and Recall Scores of Different ML Models by creating their Classification Reports.
     
    o	Performed comparison analysis to find out the Best Fit Machine Learning Model suitable for this task.
  
    o	Analysed the relationship between the sentiments and ratings of the users.

    1. Started with cleaning the Data using Pandas by Dropping the Duplicates and Null values.
    
    2. Created a new Data Frame with only relevant columns out of the initial Data Frame.
 
    3. Also Replaced values in Ratings columns to Numbers based on their Intensity and exported the Cleaned data as CSV to use it further for Sentimental Analysis.
    
    4. Imported the Cleaned data in another ipynb file for Sentimental Analysis. 
    
    5. Performed Sentiment Intensity Analysis and based on it's score, categorized the Data as Positive or Negative and made a column out of it in the Data Frame and performed analysis on it.
    
    6. Removed special charcters and stop words present in the text and performed Vectorization (feature extraction) on it.
   
    7. Built different ML models like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest and compared them on the basis of their Accuracy Score and other Key Metrics, to find out the best fit model for the task.

   1. Around 38% of the users have Negative Sentiments, whereas rest 62% have Positive Sentiments for Twitter's Services. This shows healthy User Satisfaction.
   
   2. Users providing Ratings as 1 are having highest Negative Sentiment bearing User Population.
   
   3. Whereas, those Users who provided Ratings as 3 are having highest Positive Sentiment bearing User Population.
   
   4. The Random Forest ML Model with about 90% Accuracy Score is found the Best Fit Model for this task.
